# Keyless Motorcycle Ignition with a Ring (NFC)
The purpose of this project is to turn on the ignition of a motorcycle with the use of a NFC tag (Near Field Communication). The heart of the system is the ATmega328, the microcontroller used for the famous Arduino Uno.

## How do I build one?
Please watch the video on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5zFth1xWRZ7Q3uHYjTIpnA) or [Odysee](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5zFth1xWRZ7Q3uHYjTIpnA)
Lastly, make sure to read the documentation. There you will find the materials and tool to build the system as well as several sections where we discussed the working principles of the system more in detail. The rest of the files, code, PCB files, 3D files are locared in this repository.

## How do I contribute?
First off, thank you for you time! In the second page of the documentation, there is a brief description of how you can do it. Since the whole system is an ongoing project, I wll update this page for any updates. 

## Enjoy!
