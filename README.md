# Keyless Motorcycle Ignition with a Ring (NFC)
The purpose of this project is to turn on the ignition of a motorcycle with the use of a NFC tag (Near Field Communication). A couple of highlights of the system are: 
- System consumes no current when the motorycle is off to prevent discharging the battery.
- Being able to save up to 128 different tags in memory which can be used as keys.
- Access to "Modes" such as Save/Delete Tag Mode and Erase All Tags Mode.
- Modular hardware design for prototyping/updgrades.

## How do I build one?
Please watch the video on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/Ip3jwV7dnoM) or [Odysee](https://odysee.com/@AsyssComplex:1/keyless.motorcycle.ignition.with.ring:4?r=8kbGTNhCZ6iqTXnwzbdhoQCgzBPm1UvK).
Lastly, make sure to read [the documentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D22VbdVqOc0YWlI75PouFQuNAUfmh6G7/view?usp=sharing). There you will find the materials and tools to build the system as well as several sections where we discuss the working principles of the system more in detail. The rest of the files, code, PCB files, 3D files are located in this repository.

## How do I contribute?
In the second page of the documentation, there is a brief description of how you can do it. You can also reach out to me at my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Cristi4n_Ariel). Since the whole system is an ongoing project, I will edit this page and the description of the videos for future updates. Don't forget that you can also share your thoughts on the comment section of the videos.
