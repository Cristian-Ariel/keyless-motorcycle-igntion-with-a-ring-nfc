# Keyless Motorcycle Ignition System with a Ring (NFC)
[![IMAGE ALT TEXT](http://img.youtube.com/vi/Ip3jwV7dnoM/sddefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/Ip3jwV7dnoM)

The purpose of the system is to enable the ignition of a motorcycle without the use of a physical key, by utilizing an NFC tag (Near Field Communication). A few key features of the system include:
- Zero current consumption when the motorcycle is off, preventing battery discharge.
- The ability to store up to 128 different tags in memory, which are used as keys.
- Access to "Modes" such as Save/Delete Tag Mode and Erase All Tags Mode to prevent unauthorized use.
- A modular hardware design for prototyping and upgrades to accommodate different motorcycle makes and models.

## How do I build one?
Please watch the video on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/Ip3jwV7dnoM) or [Odysee](https://odysee.com/@AsyssComplex:1/keyless.motorcycle.ignition.with.ring:4?r=8kbGTNhCZ6iqTXnwzbdhoQCgzBPm1UvK).
Lastly, make sure to read [the documentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D22VbdVqOc0YWlI75PouFQuNAUfmh6G7/view?usp=sharing). There you will find the materials and tools to build the system as well as several sections where we discuss the working principles of the system more in detail. The rest of the files, code, PCB files, 3D files are located in this repository.

## How do I contribute?
In the second page of the documentation, there is a brief description of how you can do it. Since the whole system is an ongoing project, I will edit this page and the description of the videos for future updates. Don't forget that you can also share your thoughts on the comment section of the videos.

If you find this project useful and would like to support it, you can buy something (shirts, cups, stickers, etc.) on [this store](https://asyss-complex.creator-spring.com) or you can make a donation on [paypal](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/Cristi4nAriel).
